### Value

> Average human reading speed on a screen of 150 wpm is used. Tried it!

### Usage

To use the library, simply embed **wordradar.js** in your HTML, as shown below.

`<script src="wordradar.js"></script>`

Then, add the ID `word_radar` to the element you want Wordradar to track, e.g:

`<p id="word_radar"> Your Large Paragraph </p>`

Once that's done, add the ID `word_radar_time` to an element you want, e.g:

`<p id="word_radar_time"> </p>`

This will show the time in minutes or seconds for the text you tagged.
